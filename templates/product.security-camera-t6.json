        "description": "The key to KAWA T6’s performance lies in its innovative features. The cameras are equipped with a 1\/3\" stacked CMOS sensor that enhances data analysis speed and ensures superior night vision capabilities. Furthermore, KAWA T6 security camera boasts an F1.0 super-large aperture lens. This substantial increase in light collection significantly enhances visibility in low-light environments. With an exceptional 4MP super HD resolution, KAWA T6 security camera provides crystal-clear image details. Its true color night vision technology ensures vivid and accurate color representation even in the darkest conditions. To achieve true color night vision, KAWA T6 relies not only on the lens and sensor technology but also on powerful chipsets and advanced algorithms. The camera features a quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU, clocked at up to 1GHz, significantly boosting overall performance. Additionally, the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) operates at 4TOPs@INT4, delivering four times faster deep neural network-based AI computing."
