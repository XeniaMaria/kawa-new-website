But you can set the sound sensitivity level really high so if it hears a sound the screen will come back on. The screen and sound will then turn off again when it’s quiet. You can set how long you would like it to be on for before it goes onto sleep mode again I.e 3 minuets."

We think that it is better to keep the camera working continuously so that every moment of the baby can not be missed.
